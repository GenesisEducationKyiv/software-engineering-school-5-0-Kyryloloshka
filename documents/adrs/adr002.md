## Context

The project requires sending email notifications to users for subscription confirmation and regular weather updates. The solution must be easy to integrate with NestJS, support SMTP, allow local testing, and be configurable for different providers.

## Options

1. **Third-party API services (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)**
   - Easy integration via REST API.
   - May require paid plans and registration.
   - Less flexibility for local development.

2. **SMTP via Nodemailer**
   - Works with any SMTP provider (Gmail, Mailtrap, etc.).
   - Easily configurable and testable locally.
   - Well-supported in the Node.js ecosystem and integrates with NestJS.

## Decision

Use **Nodemailer** with SMTP configuration for sending emails. All credentials and SMTP settings are managed via environment variables.

## Consequences

- Flexibility to switch SMTP providers without code changes.
- Easy local testing and debugging.
- Must monitor SMTP provider limits and reliability.
