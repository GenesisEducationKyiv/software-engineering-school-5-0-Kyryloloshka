# ADR 004: Microservices Architecture Migration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Weather Forecast API was initially built as a monolithic application with all functionality contained within a single NestJS service. As the application grew and requirements became more complex, we needed to address several challenges:

1. **Scalability**: Different parts of the system have different scaling requirements
2. **Technology Diversity**: Weather data fetching and email delivery have different performance characteristics
3. **Team Development**: Multiple developers working on different features simultaneously
4. **Deployment Flexibility**: Need to deploy and update services independently
5. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one component shouldn't affect the entire system

## Decision

We decided to migrate from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture with three main services:

### 1. API Gateway (`apps/api-gateway`)
- **Purpose**: Single entry point for all client requests
- **Responsibilities**: Request routing, authentication, rate limiting, API documentation
- **Technology**: NestJS with gRPC clients

### 2. Weather Service (`apps/weather`)
- **Purpose**: Handle all weather-related operations
- **Responsibilities**: Weather data fetching, caching, provider management
- **Technology**: NestJS with Redis caching

### 3. Subscription Service (`apps/subscription`)
- **Purpose**: Handle all subscription and email operations
- **Responsibilities**: User management, email delivery, scheduled jobs
- **Technology**: NestJS with PostgreSQL and SMTP

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Independent Scaling**: Each service can be scaled independently based on load
2. **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack
3. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't cascade to others
4. **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work on different services independently
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed and updated independently
6. **Performance Optimization**: Each service can be optimized for its specific use case

### Negative Consequences

1. **Increased Complexity**: More moving parts and inter-service communication
2. **Network Overhead**: gRPC calls between services add latency
3. **Data Consistency**: Distributed data management is more complex
4. **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
5. **Development Complexity**: Need to manage multiple codebases and deployments

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Service Mesh**: Future implementation of Istio for advanced traffic management
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement resilience patterns for inter-service communication
3. **Distributed Tracing**: Add Jaeger for request tracing across services
4. **Centralized Logging**: Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
5. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring for all services

## Implementation Details

### Communication Protocol
- **gRPC with Protocol Buffers**: High-performance binary protocol for inter-service communication
- **REST APIs**: For external integrations (Weather APIs, SMTP)

### Service Discovery
- **Docker Network**: Services communicate using container names
- **Environment Variables**: Service URLs configured via environment variables

### Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Subscription service owns the database
- **Shared Cache**: Redis for weather data caching and session storage
- **Eventual Consistency**: Acceptable for weather data updates

### Deployment Strategy
- **Docker Compose**: For development and testing
- **Container Orchestration**: Ready for Kubernetes deployment
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: For zero-downtime updates
