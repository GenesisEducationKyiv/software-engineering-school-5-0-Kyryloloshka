## Context

The application fetches weather data from external APIs. To ensure high availability and reliability, the system should be able to switch to a backup provider if the primary API is unavailable or returns an error.

## Options

1. **Single API Provider**
   - Simpler implementation.
   - Risk of downtime if the provider is unavailable.

2. **Manual Fallback Logic**
   - Hardcoded fallback, less flexible for future changes.

3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
   - Each provider is a handler in a chain.
   - If one provider fails, the request is passed to the next.
   - Easily extendable for more providers.

## Decision

Implement the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern for the API gateway. Each weather provider is a handler; if the current provider fails, the next one is tried automatically.

## Consequences

- Improved reliability and fault tolerance.
- Easy to add or remove providers in the future.
- Slightly increased complexity in the gateway logic.
